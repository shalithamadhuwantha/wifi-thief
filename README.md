### DATABASE CONNECTIVITY (FIREBASE) 
We use firebase to handle your victim computers.. (The database backup json file is in the folder) 
Basically we have a run child and a device child .. 
### <u> runner </u>
runner child has a looping key and a running key <br>
looping key = If the looping key  is true, the spyware will run until you set the looping key to false <br>
runner = If driver is false, your spyware is not working and is in a dead (down) state <br>
##### TIPS ðŸ“œ
If you want to run your spyware once, you need to set loop key to false and run key to true

### <u> device </u>
 device  child  helps manage your victims ...It is updated and edited by spyware<br>
 last date key = This will help you to know the last date your wifi key was updated
